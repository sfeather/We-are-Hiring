# We-are-Hiring

We Are Hiring! is a desktop app that helps companies hire people easier.
- As a manager, you can accept or deny job requests, post new job opportunities and you can also see all the details about employees.
- As a user, you can apply for active job opportunities; you also have a notification page where you can find out if your application has been accepted or not. You can set up your favourite companies and by doing this, you will receive notifications when a job inside one of that companies is available.
